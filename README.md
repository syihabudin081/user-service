# User Profile Microservice

This project implements a user profile microservice in Go using a microservices architecture pattern. It provides a RESTful API for managing user profiles in a PostgreSQL database. The microservice is designed to be clean, maintainable, and scalable, leveraging several Go libraries and tools to ensure robustness and performance.

## Design Choices

1. **Project Structure**:
    - The codebase is organized into `controller`, `service`, `repository`, and `model` packages. This separation of concerns helps maintain a clean and maintainable code structure, making it easy to scale and manage as the application grows.
    - The structure adheres to best practices like configuration management and dependency injection, ensuring that components remain loosely coupled and easy to test.

2. **Libraries and Frameworks**:
    - **Go Fiber**: Chosen for its speed and simplicity in building RESTful APIs, inspired by Express.js.
    - **GORM**: A powerful and flexible ORM library used for interacting with PostgreSQL, making database operations easier and more efficient.
    - **PostgreSQL Driver**: Used to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    - **Go Validator**: Ensures input data is validated before processing, preventing malformed data from affecting the application.
    - **Testify**: A toolkit for writing unit tests and mocking the database for isolated testing.

## Handling Database Connections and Transactions

- **GORM**: The application uses GORM to manage database connections. GORM supports connection pooling, which optimizes performance by reusing active connections.
- **Data Integrity**: Transactions in GORM are used where atomicity is required, ensuring that either all operations are completed or none are applied.
- **Connection Management**: Database connections are established at the start of the service and managed efficiently. The application ensures that connections are properly closed when the service shuts down.

## Error Handling

- **Error Handling**: The service uses simple `err != nil` checks to handle errors throughout the code. This approach ensures errors are caught and managed appropriately without the use of a separate error package.
- **Edge Cases**:
    - If a user tries to update or delete a non-existent entry, the service returns an appropriate error message.
    - Database connection failures are handled gracefully, and the application provides informative feedback without crashing.
- **Input Validation**: Using the `Go Validator` library, incoming requests are checked for valid data formats and constraints before any database operations.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: `Testify` is used to write unit tests for the service and repository layers. The database layer is mocked to isolate the logic and test different scenarios without needing a real database.
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive tests ensure that the API endpoints work as expected with a real PostgreSQL setup. Docker Compose is used to spin up the application and database for testing purposes.

## Deployment and Monitoring

### Deployment

The microservice is containerized using Docker and can be orchestrated using Kubernetes:

- **Docker Compose**: Used for local development and testing, running both the application and the PostgreSQL database in containers.
- **Kubernetes**: For production deployment, the microservice can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. This setup ensures high availability, scalability, and efficient resource management.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Deployed to monitor the service's performance metrics, such as request rates, error rates, and latency.
- **ELK Stack**: Used for logging and real-time log analysis. The logs help diagnose issues and track the application's health.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Alerts are configured in Prometheus to notify the team in case of performance degradation or errors.

## How to Run the Microservice

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your environment variables in a `.env` file (e.g., database credentials, ports).
3. Use Docker Compose to build and start the service:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description               |
|--------|------------------- |---------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/users`          | Fetch all user profiles   |
| GET    | `/api/users/:id`      | Get a specific user by ID |
| POST   | `/api/users`          | Create a new user profile |
| PATCH    | `/api/users/:id`      | Update a user profile     |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id`      | Delete a user profile     |

## Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: Use `Testify` to mock the database and test the service layer independently.
2. **Integration Tests**: Use a real database instance (via Docker Compose) to verify the complete workflow of API endpoints.

## Deployment to Production

1. **Containerization**: Use Docker to package the application.
2. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Define deployment and service YAML files for Kubernetes.
3. **Helm**: Optionally, use Helm for better management of configurations and updates.
4. **CI/CD**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

## Monitoring and Logging in Production

- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Set up to monitor application performance and set alerts. visualizing metrics like request rates, error rates, and latency.
- **ELK Stack**: For centralized logging and easier debugging.
- **Metrics and Health Checks**: Expose Prometheus metrics and configure health checks for the Kubernetes deployment.
